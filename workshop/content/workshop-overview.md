### A few notes about this workshop

* You should follow it from start to finish, as order does matter
* There is some information required to complete the sections that will be provide to you by whomever is running the workshop from VMware Tanzu
* The environment are somewhat resource constrained, ie. you don't have a lot of memory and CPU to work with in terms of creating pods and such, so if a pod is not coming up it's likely because of lack of memory/CPU quota
